## Persisting Data/Images

If you are using the quick install, note that Trow will store images and metadata in a Kubernetes
[emptyDir volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir). This means that
the data will survive pod restarts, but will be lost if the Trow pod is deleted or evicted from the
node it is running on. This can occur when a node fails or is brought down for maintenance.

The standard install initialises a Kubernetes [Persistent
Volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/), as a permanent store of
data. This should be reattached in the case of node or pod failure, thus avoiding data loss.

If your cluster does not support Persistent Volumes, or you would like to use a different driver
(e.g. cephfs) you will need to manually assign a volume. This should be straightforward, but is
cluster-specific. Make sure that the volume is writeable by the Trow user (user id 333333 by
default). Normally this is taken care of by the `fsGroup` setting in the `securityContext` part of
the deployment YAML, but this may not work for certain types of volume e.g. `hostPath` - in these
cases you may need to perform an explicit `chown` or `chmod` using the UID of the Trow user.

Backing up the Trow registry can be done by copying the data directory (`/data` by default). 

## Proxying the Docker Hub

Trow can be configured as a proxy cache for Docker Hub images by passing the argument
`--proxy-docker-hub` on start-up. Any repositories under `f/docker/` will automatically be pulled
from the Docker Hub. For example, if we start Trow with:

```
$ trow --proxy-docker-hub 
Starting Trow 0.3.1-PROXY on 0.0.0.0:8443

**Validation callback configuration

  By default all remote images are denied, and all local images present in the repository are allowed

  These host names will be considered local (refer to this registry): ["0.0.0.0"]
  Images with these prefixes are explicitly allowed: ["k8s.gcr.io/", "docker.io/containersol/trow"]
  Images with these names are explicitly allowed: []
  Local images with these prefixes are explicitly denied: []
  Local images with these names are explicitly denied: []

Docker Hub repostories are being proxy-cached under f/docker/
```

And then make the following request to the empty registry:

```
$ docker pull localhost:8443/f/docker/nginx:latest
latest: Pulling from f/docker/nginx
bb79b6b2107f: Already exists 
5a9f1c0027a7: Pull complete 
b5c20b2b484f: Pull complete 
166a2418f7e8: Pull complete 
1966ea362d23: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:34f3f875e745861ff8a37552ed7eb4b673544d2c56c7cc58f9a9bec5b4b3530e
Status: Downloaded newer image for localhost:8443/f/docker/nginx:latest
localhost:8443/f/docker/nginx:latest
```

Trow will keep a cached copy and check for new versions on each pull. The check is done via a HEAD
request which does not count towards the Docker rate limits. If the image cannot be pulled a cached
version will be returned, if available. This can be used to effectively mitigate issues with the
Docker Hub.

An account can be configured to use Trow, which will ensure it has it's own rate limit quota. To
use this, you will need to obtain a token from the Docker Hub (see
https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/). The user and token can then be specified on
start-up e.g:

```
$ trow --proxy-docker-hub --hub-user amouat --hub-token ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff
Starting Trow 0.3.1-PROXY on 0.0.0.0:8443

**Validation callback configuration

  By default all remote images are denied, and all local images present in the repository are allowed

  These host names will be considered local (refer to this registry): ["0.0.0.0"]
  Images with these prefixes are explicitly allowed: ["k8s.gcr.io/", "docker.io/containersol/trow"]
  Images with these names are explicitly allowed: []
  Local images with these prefixes are explicitly denied: []
  Local images with these names are explicitly denied: []

Docker Hub repostories are being proxy-cached under f/docker/

Trow is up and running!
```

As with passwords, the token can (and should) be loaded from a file:

```
$ trow --proxy-docker-hub --hub-user amouat --hub-token-file ./.hub_token
Starting Trow 0.3.1-PROXY on 0.0.0.0:8443

**Validation callback configuration

  By default all remote images are denied, and all local images present in the repository are allowed

  These host names will be considered local (refer to this registry): ["0.0.0.0"]
  Images with these prefixes are explicitly allowed: ["k8s.gcr.io/", "docker.io/containersol/trow"]
  Images with these names are explicitly allowed: []
  Local images with these prefixes are explicitly denied: []
  Local images with these names are explicitly denied: []

Docker Hub repostories are being proxy-cached under f/docker/

Trow is up and running!
```

## Listing Repositories and Tags

Trow implements the [OCI Distribution
Specification](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/main/spec.md) which
includes API methods for listing repositories and tags. Unfortunately the Docker CLI doesn't support
these endpoints, so we need to use a third-party tool. It is possible to use curl, but this gets
complicated when dealing with password protected registries, so we recommend the [docker-ls
tool](https://github.com/mayflower/docker-ls).

Using `docker-ls` is fairly straightforward, for example, to list all repositories in a registry:

```
docker-ls repositories -u myuser -p mypass -r https://registry.trow.io
requesting list . done
repositories:
- alpine
- one/two
- user1/web
- user2/web
```

To list all tags for a repository:

```
docker-ls tags user1/web -u myuser -p mypass -r https://registry.trow.io
requesting list . done
repository: user1/web
tags:
- default
- test
```

If you want to play with the underlying APIs, the URL for listing repositories is `/v2/_catalog` and
the tags for any given repository can be listed with `/v2/<repository_name>/tags/list`.

The catalog endpoint is a matter of debate by the OCI and may be replaced in future versions.  Do
not expect different registries to have compatible implementations of this endpoint for historical
reasons and ambiguities in specification.

## Multiplatform Builds

Trow has builds for amd64, armv7 and arm64. Images with a release version but no explicit platform e.g. `trow:0.3` or `trow:0.3.2` should be _multiplatform_ images that will automatically pull the correct version of the image for the current platform. Images tagged `latest` or `default` are currently amd64 only. Images should be pushed to both [GHCR](https://github.com/orgs/ContainerSolutions/packages/container/package/trow%2Ftrow) and the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/containersol/trow).

If there's another build you would like to see, please get in contact.

## Troubleshooting

### Where are the logs?

The first place to look for debugging information is in the output from the
`kubectl describe` command. It's worth looking at the output for the deployment,
replicaset and pod. Assuming the namespace for the Trow is "trow" (if you used the quick-install it
will be kube-public):

```
$ kubectl describe deploy -n trow trow-deploy
$ kubectl describe replicaset -n trow trow-deploy
$ kubectl describe pod -n trow trow-deploy
```

In particular, look for problems pulling images or with containers crashing.

For the actual application logs try:

```
$ kubectl logs -n trow trow-deploy-596bf849c8-m7b7l
```

The ID at the end of your pod name will be different, but you should be able to
use autocomplete to get the correct name (hit the tab key after typing
"trow-deploy").

If there are no logs or you get output like: 

```
Error from server (BadRequest): container "trow-pod" in pod "trow-deploy-6f6f8fbc6d-rndtd" is waiting to start: PodInitializing
```

Look at the logs for the init container:

```
$ kubectl logs -n trow trow-deploy-596bf849c8-m7b7l -c trow-init
```

If you used the quick-install, the `copy-certs` job may also log errors:

```
$ kubectl logs -n kube-public copy-certs-925a5126-48bd-43d4-b9ea-3f792519b051-fznp8
```

### I can't push images into Trow

If you get an error like:

```
$ docker push trow.kube-public:31000/nginx:alpine
The push refers to repository [trow.kube-public:31000/nginx]
Get https://trow.kube-public:31000/v2/: dial tcp 192.168.39.211:31000: connect: no route to host
```

Your client isn't reaching the Trow service. Please check the following:

 - Verify that Trow is running (e.g. `kubectl get deploy -n trow
   trow-deploy`). If not, refer to the section on logs above to diagnose the
   issue. 
 - Check that a service exists for Trow (e.g. `kubectl describe svc -n
   trow trow`). 
 - Check that your network or cloud provider isn't blocking access. 

_The rest of the advice in this question is applicable only to the quick-install_

 - Ensure port 31000 is accessible. This will likely mean editing network rules if using a public
   cloud.
 - Make sure that your client is pointing to the correct address. The IP address given in the error
   message should match the public IP of one of the cluster nodes. If it doesn't, try running the
   `install/configure-host.sh` script.

If you get an error like:

```
$ docker push trow.kube-public:31000/nginx:alpine
The push refers to repository [trow.kube-public:31000/nginx]
Get https://trow.kube-public:31000/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

This indicates the Docker client doesn't trust the remote server. To fix this,
we need to add Kubernetes CA certificate or the Trow certificate to Docker. The
easiest way to do this is by running the `install/configure-host.sh`, which
should place the correct under `/etc/docker/certs.d/_registry-name_`.  

If you get an error like:

```
docker push trow.kube-public:31000/nginx:alpine
The push refers to repository [trow.kube-public:31000/nginx]
Get https://trow.kube-public:31000/v2/: dial tcp: lookup trow.kube-public: No address associated with hostname
```

This indicates it can't resolve the host name. Running `install/configure-host.sh` should add an
entry to `/etc/hosts` that will fix the issue.

If it seems like you can connect to Trow successfully but then uploads fail with `manifest invalid`
or `Internal Server Error`, Trow may be having trouble saving to the filesystem. First check
the logs (see "Where are the logs?" above). If this is the case, check there is free space on the
volume and the Trow user has the correct privileges to write to the volume. In particular, verify
that the settings for the volume match the UID of the Trow user (333333 by default):

```
...
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: trow-pod
        image: containersol/trow:0.3
	...
      securityContext:             
        runAsUser: 333333
        runAsGroup: 333333
        fsGroup: 333333
```

### My pod can't pull images from Trow

If a deployment isn't starting, check the logs for the replica set e.g:

```
$ kubectl get rs my-app-844d6db962
...
```

If there is a failed create message, the image may have been refused validation by Trow. If the message reads like:

```
Error creating: admission webhook "validator.trow.io" denied the request: *Remote* image docker.io/nginx disallowed as not contained in this registry and not in allow list
```

That means Trow considered the image name to refer to a _remote_ repository (i.e. not Trow itself)
which has not been added to the allow list. If you believe the image should have been considered
local, check the repository address appears in the list of addresses passed to Trow on start-up with
the `-n` switch. If you want to allow a single remote image, add it to Trow by using the
`--allow-images` flag. If you want to allow a whole repository or subdirectory of a repository use
`--allow-prefixes`.

If the message reads:

```
Error creating: admission webhook "validator.trow.io" denied the request: Local image trow.kube-public:31000/notpresent disallowed as not contained in this registry and not in allow list
```

It means Trow expected to be able to serve this image itself but it wasn't found in the repository.
Either push the image or use the `allow-images` or `allow-prefixes` flag to pre-approve images. Note
that Kubernetes will keep trying to validate images.

If you get the error:

```
Error creating: Internal error occurred: failed calling admission webhook "validator.trow.io": Post https://trow.kube-public.svc:443/validate-image?timeout=30s: no endpoints available for service "trow"
```

Trow probably isn't running. You will need to disable the admission webhook and restart Trow. To
disable the webhook run `kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfigurations.admissionregistration.k8s.io
trow-validator`. If Trow doesn't restart automatically, refer to the other sections on
troubleshooting or try reinstalling.

If the error is not to do with validation and you used the quick-install, it may be that the node is
unable to pull from the Trow registry. By default nodes are configured by the `copy-certs` job. You
can check that the job completed successfully with `kubectl get jobs -n kube-public`. If the node is
new, try running the script `install/copy-certs.sh`.


```
The push refers to repository [trow.kube-public:31000/test/nginx]
Get https://trow.kube-public:31000/v2/: x509: certificate signed by unknown authority
```

If you get this error, and you are using the quick install on Docker for Mac, try restarting Docker.

### Permission Denied Errors in Logs

If you get errors such as `{ code: 13, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Permission denied" }`, it is
possible that Trow can't write to the data directory. Please verify that the data volume is
accessible and writeable by the Trow user. If not, please use `chown` or `chmod` to give the Trow
user access. As the Trow user only exists in the container, you will likely need to use it's
equivalent UID e.g. `chown 333333 /data`.

### Errors When Pushing or Pulling Large Images

If you get errors when dealing with large images, but not with smaller images, you may need to
configure your ingress to explicitly allow large transfers. For example, if you are using the
NGINX ingress, add the following annotation to the Kubernetes configuration:


```
nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-body-size: "0"
```
